I decided to go with the low cost [fpv 250 kit](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__52863__HobbyKing_Spec_FPV250_V2_Quad_Copter_ARF_Combo_Kit_Mini_Sized_FPV_Multi_Rotor_ARF_.html) from hobbyking. It comes with four motors, the ESCs, the battery, the propellers and the chassis. As of the flight controller, I  decided to ditch the idea of using traditional RC since it won't be controlled manually. I went for the Arduino as always. We all know that this isn't the long term solution but hey, it's really good for prototyping. As of communications, I went for [the XBee kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13197) from SparkFun. I was originally considering using a camera for the visuals of the drone. The transmission of the video would be a hassle and it wouldn't be fast enough to localize the drone. So I decided using a LIDAR and SLAM would be the fastest way to localize the drone. Now the problem is LIDARs are expensive. There are two solutions I found. One of them is to use the LIDAR LITE V2 from Pulsed Light as the laser range finder. It has a 40 m range and high precision. It costs a little over $100 but it's out of stock everywhere. The other solution was the LIDAR ripped out from the Neato cleaning robot. It has a reasonable size and cost just around $80. I also found documentations on how to use it with Arduino and ROS. I'll update the documentations and details later along the project. So the whole thing comes down to about less than $250. If it works, it's probably the cheapest autonomous drone on the market.",
